## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 

 I chose to include my profile picture in the top section of my home page, which is minimalist and includes a 'hero' section introducing me by name and with a short sentence about who I am. My biography is in my 'about' section, which is directly below my 'hero' as you scroll down. I wanted my 'hero' to be really minimalistic and clean, but with all my important info directly below, as most people would likely scroll down instinctively. I have then included a 'projects' overview, which has 3 article sections showing a picture and brief description of a few selected projects, with a button linked to a separate page for each project and a larger button below to link to another page that lists all of my projects. Below this is my contact form, which will send to my email. My 'about' section includes links to my resume, my Github and my LinkedIn, and I have the same Github and LinkedIn icons in the footer of each page. The most important information of my site is on the home page, with menu links that scroll down to each sectiion, and more in depth details of my projects are found on separate pages, which I thought kept the site looking clean, organised and easy to navigate.
